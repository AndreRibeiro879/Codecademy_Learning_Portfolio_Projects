This project aims to develop and share visualization skills gathered during the Codecademy Data Scientist: Machine Learning Specialist course path.

For this project, data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank will be analyzed to identify the relationship between GDP and life expectancy in six countries.

During this project, data will be analyzed, prepared, and plotted to answer questions in a meaningful way.

After performing my analysis, I will create a blog post to share my findings.

Additional Information - Data columns description:

Country - nation;
Year - the year for the observation;
Life expectancy at birth (years) - life expectancy value in years;
