This file is my first Jupyter notebook at this level of interaction.
It is related to the implementation of the Codecademy Off-platform Portfolio Project - US Medical Insurance, within the scope of the "DataScientist: Machine Learning Specialist career path" course.
It is my first learning project, where I had the possibility of applying the knowledge in Python obtained so far but also using it to collect and learn other methodologies.
If anyone can give feedback, I would be very grateful.
I am aware that there will be many mistakes but I emphasize that it is by making mistakes that we learn.
I'm not counting on mastering the language or the tools at this point.

Thank you for your support, in advance.
