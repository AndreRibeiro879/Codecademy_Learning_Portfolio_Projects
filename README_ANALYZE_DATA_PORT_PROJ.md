This file is used to describe the Analyze_Data_Port_Proj Jupyter Notebook file, which was created under the scope of the 
Analyze Data with Python Portfolio Project subject from CodeCademy Analyze Data with Python Skill path course.

The dataset used to perform it was downloaded from Kaggle and it's name is: Diabetes prediction dataset - 
A Comprehensive Dataset for Predicting Diabetes with Medical & Demographic Data.

Kaggle's description of the dataset:

"About Dataset
The Diabetes prediction dataset is a collection of medical and demographic data from patients, along with their diabetes status (positive or negative). 
The data includes features such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. 
This dataset can be used to build machine learning models to predict diabetes in patients based on their medical history and demographic information. 
This can be useful for healthcare professionals in identifying patients who may be at risk of developing diabetes and in developing personalized treatment plans. 
Additionally, the dataset can be used by researchers to explore the relationships between various medical and demographic factors and the likelihood of developing 
diabetes."
