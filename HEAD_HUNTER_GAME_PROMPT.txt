First Prompt:


I want to create a python terminal game called Head Hunter Game with object oriented programming (classes and methods).

My game is based on 10 random coin toss and all the players should guess the result of that.

This game, should allow multiplayers entries, and every player should input its name and its guess before game starts.

The game should have a ranking board where the players results should be written for each attempt and a board for a general classification with the summary of total earned points.

The rules are simple:

- Before the game start every player should input its name (as a start point of the game and only one time) and its guess ("head" or "tail") - it is necessary allow upper and lowercase characters in both name and guess inputs;

- For each guessed head the player earn 5 points. For each guessed tail, the player should earn 2 points. If a player guessed wrongly the result it should loose -3 points.

- The first player earnning a total of 100 points win the game.

- The game should run until a player reachs 100 points.
Could you help me with code?
