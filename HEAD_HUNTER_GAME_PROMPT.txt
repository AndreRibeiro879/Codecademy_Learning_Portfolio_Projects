First Prompt:

I want to create a Python terminal game called Head Hunter Game using object-oriented programming (classes and methods).

My game is based on 10 random coin tosses, and all the players should guess the result of each toss.

This game should allow multiple players to enter, and every player should input their name and their guess before the game starts.

The game should have a ranking board where the players’ results are recorded for each attempt, and a board for a general classification with a summary of total earned points.


The rules are simple:

- Before the game starts, every player should input their name (as a starting point of the game and only one time) and their guess (“head” or “tail”). It is necessary to allow both uppercase and lowercase characters in both name and guess inputs.

- For each guessed head, the player earns 5 points. For each guessed tail, the player earns 2 points. If a player guesses incorrectly, they lose 3 points.

- The first player to earn a total of 50 points wins the game.

- The game should run until a player reaches 50 points.

Could you help me with the code?

Second Prompt:

Regarding your code suggestion, the game should ask for the number of players, then the names of the players, and then their guesses before starting. Is it necessary to correct it?
