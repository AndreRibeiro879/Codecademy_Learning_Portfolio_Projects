    "In this project, I apply data science, data analysis, and data visualization technics, to explore biodiversity patterns using two datasets - `species_info.csv` and `observations.csv` - provided by Codecademy. Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn are used to process, analyze, and visualize the data. The goal is to uncover insights into species richness, conservation status distribution, and ecological representation across U.S. national parks.\n",

    "\n",
    "According to United Nations (UN), biodiversity - or biological diversity - is defined as the \"variety of life on Earth, in all its forms, from genes and bacteria to entire ecosystems as forests or coral reefs\" **[1]**. Biodiversity plays a vital role in sustaining life on Earth by supporting food production, clean water, medicine, climate stability, and economic growth supported, i.e., by robust ecosystem services such as pollination, water purification, and climate regulation. Over half of the global GDP depends on nature, and forests and oceans could act as carbon sinks, absorbing more than half of all carbon emissions **[1]**. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this delicate and invaluable richness is increasingly threatened by human activities. Land use ‚Äî particularly agriculture ‚Äî is the leading driver of biodiversity loss, while climate change continues to accelerate species extinction and ecosystem collapse **[1]**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop practical skills in data analysis and interpretation using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The datasets, provided by Codecademy, focus on biodiversity ‚Äî a critical component of ecological resilience and sustainability. Two CSV files are used: `species_info.csv`, which contains metadata about various species, and `observations.csv`, which records species sightings across national parks. Through exploratory analysis and visualization, the project seeks to uncover patterns in species distribution and conservation status.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the analysis aims to explore ecological representation across protected areas, identifying trends in species richness and conservation priorities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‚ÑπÔ∏è1.1 - Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**`species_info.csv`contains:**\n",
    "- `category`: Broad classification of the species (e.g., Mammal, Bird, Reptile);\n",
    "- `scientific_name`: Latin name of the species;\n",
    "- `common_names`: Common names used to refer to the species;\n",
    "- `conservation_status`: Indicates if the species is endangered, threatened, or of least concern;\n",
    "\n",
    "**`observations.csv` contains:**\n",
    "- `scientific_name`: Latin name of the species observed;\n",
    "- `park_name`: Name of the national park where the observation was recorded;\n",
    "- `observations`: Number of times the species was observed in that park;\n",

    "\n",
    "This project employs a structured data analysis workflow to explore biodiversity patterns across U.S. national parks. The methodology is designed to address the core themes outlined in the title and introduction: conservation status and species distribution.\n",
    "Moreover, it is also intended, to practice and employ data science, data analysis and data visualization technics, gathered during \"Data Scientist: Machine Learning Specialist - career Path\" course.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üõú2.1 - Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "Two datasets provided by Codecademy form the basis of this analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `species_info.csv`: Contains metadata on species, including category, scientific and common names, and conservation status.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `observations.csv`: Records the number of times each species was observed in specific national parks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üíª2.2 - Analytical Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess biodiversity and conservation insights, the following steps are undertaken:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Cleaning and Integration**: Ensure consistency in species naming and merge datasets where necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Use Pandas to summarize species categories, conservation status, and observation counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Visualization**: Apply Matplotlib and Seaborn to uncover patterns in species richness and conservation distribution across parks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comparative Analysis*: Identify which parks host the highest number of endangered or threatened species.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ecological Representation**: Evaluate how well different species categories are represented across protected areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üõ†Ô∏è2.3 - Tools and Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Programming Language**: Python\n",
