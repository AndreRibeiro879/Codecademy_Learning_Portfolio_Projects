    "# 1 - INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "According to United Nations (UN), biodiversity - or biological diversity - is defined as the \"variety of life on Earth, in all its forms, from genes and bacteria to entire ecosystems as forests or coral reefs\" **[1]**. Biodiversity plays a vital role in sustaining life on Earth by supporting food production, clean water, medicine, climate stability, and economic growth supported, i.e., by robust ecosystem services such as pollination, water purification, and climate regulation. Over half of the global GDP depends on nature, and forests and oceans could act as carbon sinks, absorbing more than half of all carbon emissions **[1]**. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this delicate and invaluable richness is increasingly threatened by human activities. Land use â€” particularly agriculture â€” is the leading driver of biodiversity loss, while climate change continues to accelerate species extinction and ecosystem collapse **[1]**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop practical skills in data analysis and interpretation using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The datasets, provided by Codecademy, focus on biodiversity â€” a critical component of ecological resilience and sustainability. Two CSV files are used: species_info.csv, which contains metadata about various species, and observations.csv, which records species sightings across national parks. Through exploratory analysis and visualization, the project seeks to uncover patterns in species distribution and conservation status.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the analysis aims to explore ecological representation across protected areas, identifying trends in species richness and conservation priorities.\n",

    "**`species_info.csv`contains:**\n",
    "- `category`: Broad classification of the species (e.g., Mammal, Bird, Reptile);\n",
    "- `scientific_name`: Latin name of the species;\n",
    "- `common_names`: Common names used to refer to the species;\n",
    "- `conservation_status`: Indicates if the species is endangered, threatened, or of least concern;\n",
    "\n",
    "**`observations.csv` contains:**\n",
    "- `scientific_name`: Latin name of the species observed;\n",
    "- `park_name`: Name of the national park where the observation was recorded;\n",
    "- `observations`: Number of times the species was observed in that park;\n",
