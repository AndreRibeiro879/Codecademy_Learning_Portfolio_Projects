# 🐾 Biodiversity in U.S. National Parks: A Data-Driven Exploration

## 📘 Overview
This project investigates biodiversity patterns and conservation efforts across U.S. national parks using species and observation data, during 7 days. Through data analysis and visualization, it uncovers ecological insights and highlights discrepancies in species protection.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze species richness and protection status
- Identify observation biases across parks and categories
- Visualize conservation status distribution
- Support data-driven ecological awareness

## 📂 Dataset
Provided by Codecademy:
- `species_info.csv`: Species names, categories, and conservation status
- `observations.csv`: Species observations across national parks

## 🛠️ Tools & Environment
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `numpy`
- Environment: JupyterLab

## 📊 Key Visualizations
- Species richness by category
- Protection rate by category
- Observations by park and protection status
- Top observed species vs. protection status
- Conservation status breakdown

## 🔍 Insights
- Certain species are frequently observed but lack protection
- Some parks dominate observation counts, suggesting sampling bias
- Categories like Mammals and Birds show distinct protection patterns
- Protected species are not always observed more frequently

## 📈 Statistical Highlights
- Chi-square tests reveal significant relationships between protection status and species category
- Visualizations support ecological interpretation and conservation prioritization
